        I am currently a PhD candidate in the Department of Aerospace engineering at the
        University of Michigan. My research interests are formal methods and numerical analysis.
        I am interested in answering the question: "How can we guarantee the accuracy of numerical solution?" and
        "How can obtain formal quarantees for the numerical errors ?".

        Besides research I enjoy outdoor activities like Kayaking, hiking etc. I like to workout and spend
        time with nature. I also like to take crazy road trips. I am super into rock music and I like to 
        collect vinyl records. I am a huge fan of the AC/DC, Beatles and Deep Purple.
