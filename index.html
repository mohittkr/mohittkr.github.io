            I am currently a PhD candidate in the <a href = "https://aero.engin.umich.edu/">
            Department of   Aerospace engineering</a> at the
            <a href = "https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>. I completed my masters in <a href = "https://aero.engin.umich.edu/">
            Aerospace engineering</a> at the <a href = "https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a> in 2020. 
            I received a bachelors degree in <a href= "https://iitk.ac.in/aero/">
            Aerospace engineering </a>
            from the <a href="http://iitk.ac.in/">Indian Insitute of Technology(IIT), Kanpur</a>, India in 2018. 
            My research interests are formal methods and numerical analysis. I am interested in analyzing the accuracy 
            and convergence properties of numerical schemes. I work with interactive theorem provers like Coq Proof
            assistant, HOL4, to formalize numerical approximation errors and bound them formally. I am also interested in
            automated reasoning using SMT/SAT solvers and use light weight code analysis tools like Frama-C/VST 
            to certify results obtained from numerical programs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides research I enjoy outdoor activities like Kayaking, hiking etc. I like to workout and spend
            time with nature. I also like to go on road trips and enjoy rock music. I like to 
            collect vinyl records. I am a huge fan of the AC/DC, Beatles and Deep Purple.
