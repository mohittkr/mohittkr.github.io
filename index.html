            I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Lawrence Livermore National Labs, working on the application of formal methods to high performance computing.
            I recently defended my PhD thesis titled "A Mechanized Error Analysis Framework for End-to-End Verification of Numerical Programs" at the
            <a href = "https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>. I was advised by 
            <a href = "https://aero.engin.umich.edu/people/jeannin-jean-baptiste/">Prof. Jean-Baptiste Jeannin</a>. 
            I completed my masters in <a href = "https://aero.engin.umich.edu/">
            Aerospace engineering</a> at the <a href = "https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a> in 2020, with speciciality in control theory. 
            I received a bachelors degree in <a href= "https://iitk.ac.in/aero/">
            Aerospace engineering </a>
            from the <a href="http://iitk.ac.in/">Indian Insitute of Technology(IIT), Kanpur</a>, India in 2018. 
            My research interests are formal methods, programming languages, numerical analysis and control theory. I am interested in analyzing the accuracy 
            and convergence properties of numerical schemes. I work with interactive theorem provers like Coq Proof
            assistant, HOL4, to formalize numerical approximation errors and bound them formally. I am also interested in
            automated reasoning using SMT/SAT solvers and use light weight code analysis tools like Frama-C/VST 
            to certify results obtained from numerical programs.
        </p>

        <p>
            During my PhD, my research activity has mostly been aligned in the direction of applying
            formal methods to problems in numerical analysis and control theory. I have been working
            at the intersection of formal methods and Computational mechanics (my undergraduate coursework
            and research has primarily been in this field).
        </p>
        <p>
            Besides research I enjoy outdoor activities like Kayaking, hiking etc. I like to workout and spend
            time with nature. I also like to go on road trips and enjoy rock music. I like to 
            collect vinyl records. I am a huge fan of the AC/DC, Beatles and Deep Purple.

        <h3>Teaching experience</h3>
        <p>
            I was a Graduate Teaching Assistant(GSI) for the course AERO 495 (Fundamentals of Aerospace Computing)
            in the Fall 2019 and Fall 2020 semesters. This course is an introduction to programming in C,
            computational sciences and embedded systems. I was responsible for conducting labs, grading homeworks and exams, 
            holding office hours.
