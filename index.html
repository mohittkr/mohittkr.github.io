        I am currently a PhD candidate in the <a href = "https://aero.engin.umich.edu/">
        Department of   Aerospace engineering</a> at the
        <a href = "https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>. I completed my masters in <a href = "https://aero.engin.umich.edu/">
        Aerospace engineering</a> at the <a href = "https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a>. 
        I received a bachelors degree in <a href= "https://iitk.ac.in/aero/">
        Aerospace engineering </a>
        from the <a href="http://iitk.ac.in/">Indian Insitute of Technology(IIT), Kanpur</a>, India. 
        My research interests are formal methods and numerical analysis.
        I am interested in answering the question: "How can we guarantee the accuracy of numerical solution?" and
        "How can obtain formal quarantees for the numerical errors ?".
    </p>

        Besides research I enjoy outdoor activities like Kayaking, hiking etc. I like to workout and spend
        time with nature. I also like to take crazy road trips. I am super into rock music and I like to 
        collect vinyl records. I am a huge fan of the AC/DC, Beatles and Deep Purple.
