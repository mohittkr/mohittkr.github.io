abstract="The behavior of physical systems is typically modeled using differential equations which are too complex to solve analytically. In practical problems, these equations are discretized on a computational domain, and numerical solutions are computed. A numerical scheme is called convergent, if in the limit of infinitesimal discretization, the bounds on the discretization error is also infinitesimally small. The approximate solution converges to the ``true solution'' in this limit. The Lax equivalence theorem enables a proof of convergence given consistency and stability of the method.",
